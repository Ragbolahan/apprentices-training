## Shell

The shell is an efficient and incredibly powerful textual interface to your computer.  It lets you run programs and commands.

Terms used for pretty much the same thing:
* shell
* shell prompt
* terminal
* command line
* bash shell

### Basic commands

The terminal allows you work with the files on your computer.  These files are stored in hierarchy of directories.

When we first open a terminal our working directory (the current folder you are in) will be our "home" directory.  This is the default root directory for your user.

We can see what directory we are in by entering the `pwd` command.  This stands for **p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory.

To list the files in this directory we use the `ls` command (*list*).

To move into another directory we use the `cd` command (**c**hange **d**irectory) followed by the name of that directory.
