## Installing a shell prompt

### Mac users

You don't have to install anything - just use the `Terminal` application or something else like `iTerm`.

### Windows users

You will need to install `Git BASH` from [here](https://gitforwindows.org/).  Click Download, then scroll to the bottom.  Under `Assets`, download either `Git-2.21.0-32-bit.exe` or `Git-2.21.0-64-bit.exe`.  Open the file and proceed through the installation steps.

### Downloading the repo (all users)

Go to [here](../README.md) and click on the green `Clone or download` button on the right.  Select `Download ZIP`.  Unzip the folder and move it to an accessible location.

Optionally, you can follow the instructions [here](../README.md#getting-started) if you are comfortable with Git.

**If all else fails, click the `launch binder` button [here](../README.md#getting-started).  Wait for the Jupyter homepage to load, then click on `New` -> `Terminal`.**
